This project comprises two main components: a Drum Filter  and a Drum Kit. 
The Drum Filter  serves as an interface enabling users to refine their search for drums based on specific criteria, including prices, types, and components. 
Then there is a Drum Kit where user can play some classical music using MouseClick or KeyPressing the letters written on drums.
